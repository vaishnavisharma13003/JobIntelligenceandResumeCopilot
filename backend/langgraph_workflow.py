langgraph_workflow.py - MULTI-STEP AI WORKFLOW WITH LANGGRAPH

LangGraph lets us define a pipeline of steps ("nodes") that all read/write
a SHARED STATE object, instead of manually chaining function calls together.

Graph:

    START -> analyze_resume -> analyze_job -> find_skill_gap
          -> generate_questions -> generate_learning_plan -> END
